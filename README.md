A collection of some templates I use for my LaTeX documents and Beamers


This document contains the template files I use to write reports, problem sets, and Beamers. Eventually this will contain templates for papers as well. 
The primary content (repeated throughout most template files) is my collection of custom commands which I use heavily.
